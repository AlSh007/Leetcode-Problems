This code is implementing a dynamic programming algorithm to find the number of ways that a given string "target" can be formed using substrings of a set of other strings "words".
​
The algorithm uses a 2D matrix "count" to count the occurrences of each letter in each position of the words in the "words" vector. It then uses a 1D vector "dp" to keep track of the number of ways to form the target string up to each index.
​
The algorithm iterates through each position in the target string, and for each position, it iterates through each position in the "words" strings. It then updates the dp vector by adding the number of ways to form the target string up to the previous index multiplied by the count of the current character in the current position of the "words" strings.
​
Finally, the function returns the number of ways to form the target string using substrings from the "words" vector.
